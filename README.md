### Testing the Effectiveness of a New Ad Campaign using A/B Testing
-	Python Tools: Pandas, Flask, pickle.
-	Built a statistical model to test the effectiveness of a new ad campaign.
-	Computed the p-value, compared it with user-entered signifcance level, tested the hypothesis.
-	Interactive webpage built using Flask is then hosted on Heroku: https://ab-testing-karaman.herokuapp.com/
-	Files: https://github.com/california-19/AB_Testing

### House Price Prediction
-	Python Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, Linear Regression, GridSearchCV.
-	Built a predictive ML model to predict house prices in Nashville area.
-	Suggested dividing the housing market into submarkets to improve price predictibility.
-	Achieved 83% accuracy in correctly predicting house prices.
-	Source code: https://github.com/california-19/Nashville_House_Prices

### Classifying News Articles According to Their Sources
-	Python Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, API, Scikit Learn, TfidfVectorizer, NLTK, Naïve Bayes, SVM, Keras.
-	Processed text data using NLTK. News articles are classified according to their sources.
-	Achieved 77% accuracy in correctly predicting the source of a news article.
-	Source code: https://github.com/california-19/Classifying_News_Articles

### Credit Card Fraud Detection
- Tools: PySpark, Spark SQL Dataframe, from pyspark.ml.classification library LogisticRegression, NaiveBayes, GBTClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, hosted on Databricks [here](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/1036967690196085/1546339980562946/5353975428490315/latest.html).
- Performed over and undersampling, scaling before testing algorithms. Compared the performance of four machine learning techniques for both oversampled and undersampled dataset.
- Achieved up to 98.7% accuracy rate in fraud detection.

### Adult Income Classification Problem, Income vs Education vs Relationship
-	Python Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit Learn, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost.
-	Performed supervised learning with achieving 90% accuracy.
-	Brought a twist to typical modeling and compared variables’ predictability as well. Is it easier to predict income level or relationship status? Available [here](https://github.com/california-19/Adult_Income).

### Testing the effectiveness of Belt and Road Initiative, a trade project of China, using Neural Networks
-	Python Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Neural Networks.
-	Tested if Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) member country membership makes a difference in trade volume using gravity model data in neural networks. Trained the model with member countries and used the learned parameters on non-member countries to show that their estimated trade volume is higher for 92% of the time. A more detailed description of the model is [here](https://www.cemkaraman.com/) and [here](https://github.com/california-19/BRI_testing_with_Gravity_Model).

### Predicting Income vs. Education Level on PySpark
-	Python Tools: PySpark, SQL, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
-	Applied big data machine learning techniques with Apache Spark.
-	Hosted the project on databricks.com on this [link](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/1036967690196085/532742916882471/5353975428490315/latest.html).
