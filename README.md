# Welcome to Cem Karaman's Portfolio Page
Data Scientist with a PhD in Economics, a strong math and finance background, and experience in machine learning and statistics using tools like Python, Keras, and MATLAB. Experienced in project design, hypothesis testing, predictive modeling, and analytical problem solving utilizing advanced statistical methods. Proficient in algorithm development and implementation, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, identifying patterns, clustering and visualization of data

### Classifying News Articles According to Their Sources

-	Python Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, API, Scikit Learn, TfidfVectorizer, NLTK, Naïve Bayes, SVM, Keras.
-	Processed text data using NLTK. News articles are classified according to their sources.
-	Achieved 77% accuracy in correctly predicting the source of a news article.

### Adult Income Classification Problem, Income vs Education vs Relationship
-	Python Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit Learn, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost.
-	I repeated the same project on PySpark too. The link to my host at Databricks.com is at my website https//cemkaraman.com
-	Performed supervised learning with achieving 90% accuracy.
-	Brought a twist to typical modeling and compared variables’ predictability as well. Is it easier to predict income level or relationship status? Available [here](https://github.com/california-19/Adult_Income).

### Testing the effectiveness of Belt and Road Initiative, a trade project of China, using Neural Networks
-	Python Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Neural Networks.
-	Tested if Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) member country membership makes a difference in trade volume using gravity model data in neural networks. Trained the model with member countries and used the learned parameters on non-member countries to show that their estimated trade volume is higher for 92% of the time. A more detailed description of the model is [here](https://www.cemkaraman.com/) and [here](https://github.com/california-19/BRI_testing_with_Gravity_Model).

### Predicting Income vs. Education Level on PySpark
-	Python Tools: PySpark, SQL, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
-	Applied big data machine learning techniques with Apache Spark.
-	Hosted the project on databricks.com. The link is available in my LinkedIn post and website.
